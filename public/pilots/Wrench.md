Leo, known as Wrench among his peers, is a dedicated Union Navy cadet with a remarkable past as a mechanic. Hailing from the rugged outer regions of Union space, Leo once worked as a mechanic on mining vessels. His distinctive thick beard and sturdy goggles are both vestiges of those days, serving as a reminder of his roots in the grit and grime.

Wrench is unwavering in his commitment to moral values, making him a steadfast advocate for what he believes is right. However, beneath his unshakable exterior lies a troubling secret related to a friend and Union mechanic, Amara. Leo recently discovered that Amara is secretly a member of a HORUS cell, a revelation that has shaken his sense of trust and security. 

Determined to find a way to reconcile his loyalty to Amara and his commitment to Union's values, Leo grapples with this newfound knowledge as he continues his journey within the Navy.
Leo's goal is to become the first mech pilot to master a daring and untested maneuver known as the "Solar Spiral." This maneuver, often dismissed as too risky and theoretically impossible, involves a near-impossible corkscrew motion in zero gravity, rendering the pilot's mech virtually untouchable in combat. Leo is obsessed with perfecting this maneuver, not only to prove its feasibility but also to make his mark as a pioneer of unconventional mech tactics in the Union Navy.

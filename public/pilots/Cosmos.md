Butch Ryder, known as Cosmos, was born among the stars, a child of the void. His early life took a tumultuous turn when the frigate he and his brother Duke called home faced a perilous mutiny led by ruthless pirates. In a display of unwavering determination, the Ryder brothers fought off the mutineers, deciding to dedicate their lives to the cause of justice by enlisting in the Union Navy.

Cosmos' primary goal centers on the protection of spacefaring communities, driven by the haunting memories of the pirate mutiny. His ultimate secret, closely guarded, relates to the true identity of the pirate leader, a revelation that could shake the foundations of his loyalty to Union.

<p>First Committee Dissolved, Second Committee Takes Over Union. In furious rejection of the First Committee’s perceived capitulation in the Cornucopia system, a military coup deposes the First Committee and launches a retaliatory attack aimed towards the Aunic homeworld: TBK PISTON-1, a spread of silent-flying, guided planet-killing weapon systems. The Second Committee is formally established.</p>

<p>Second Expansion Period Begins. The Second Expansion Period begins, as the Second Committee begins a massive, Unionwide colonization and expansion effort throughout the Orion Arm of the galaxy. The blink network is grown through rapid construction of gates, and billions of colonists are sent out to tens of thousands of worlds over this time. This period represents the single largest movement of human life in recorded history.</p>

<p>Cressidium is colonized. Cressidium, a planet that was settled by Union’s anthrochauvinistic Second Committee just before it was overthrown by the coalition that would eventually become the current-day Third Committee. As revolution swept throughout Union space, sparked by mounting oppression and atrocities, many SecComm bureaucrats and military commanders fled their homeworlds looking for a safe haven to ride out the storm. Among the places they fled—bringing their friends, families, and politically connected allies with them—was Cressidium, a recently charted and newly colonized world that boasted suitable Cradle-like conditions for habitation and an abundance of natural resources. Information on Cressidium’s location and its colonization was purged by those who fled there in an attempt to cover their tracks. This included scuttling the world’s omninet infrastructure to prevent detection, and in the aftermath of the revolution the world was lost from official record.</p>

<p>Union Civil War. Mounting discontent with the great expansion, the growing need to address PISTON-1, and the acute criminality of the Hercynian Crisis boil over into widespread popular revolution across Cradle and some Galactic Core worlds. Union is gripped by civil war.</p>

<p>Second Committee Surrenders. The remaining Central Committee members of the Second Committee agree to terms of surrender in 4591u. Some portions of Second Committee flee to Diasporan planets or to places such at Harrison Armory.</p>

<p>Second Committee Surrenders, Founding of Third Committee. New stable government in Union is formed, the Third Committee (ThirdComm). The Union Colonial Mission is immediately dissolved and the Union Administrative Department is reconstituted. Expansion is halted.</p>

<p>Present day and campaign start.</p>

- **First Committee Dissolved, Second Committee Takes Over Union:** In response to the perceived capitulation of the First Committee in the Cornucopia system, a military coup deposes the First Committee and launches a retaliatory attack using TBK PISTON-1, a spread of silent-flying, guided planet-killing weapon systems. The Second Committee is formally established.

- **Second Expansion Period Begins (3200-4599U):** The Second Committee initiates the Second Expansion Period, launching a massive, Unionwide colonization and expansion effort throughout the Orion Arm of the galaxy. The blink network is rapidly expanded with the construction of gates, and billions of colonists are sent to tens of thousands of worlds during this period. It marks the largest movement of human life in recorded history.

- **Cressidium Colonized:** Union establishes colonies on Cressidium, a newly charted and resource-rich world, as a part of the Second Expansion Period. The planet's location and colonization details are intentionally purged from official records by the fleeing Second Committee members.

- **Union Civil War (4560-4591U):** Widespread popular revolution erupts across Cradle and some Galactic Core worlds due to mounting discontent with the massive expansion efforts, the need to address the PISTON-1 threat, and the Hercynian Crisis. Union plunges into civil war.

- **Present Day (Campaign Start):** Operation Solstice Rain commences during Union's third visit to Cressidium. Tensions rise between major nations, the Leandric States Alliance (LSA), and the Vestan Sovereignty during ongoing diplomatic negotiations.
- The UNS-CV Rio Grande, commanded by Captain Brigid Farris, is dispatched to provide support, carrying a complement of freshly graduated mech pilots assigned to their first posting as fully trained and qualified mechanized chassis pilots.

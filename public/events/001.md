### **Timeline of Events**

- **2885U**: First Committee Dissolved, Second Committee Takes Over Union

    In furious rejection of the First Committeeâ€™s perceived capitulation in the Cornucopia system, a military coup deposes the First Committee and launches a retaliatory attack aimed towards the Aunic homeworld: TBK PISTON-1, a spread of silent-flying, guided planet-killing weapon systems. The Second Committee is formally established.

- **3200U**: Second Expansion Period Begins

    The Second Expansion Period begins, as the Second Committee begins a massive, Unionwide colonization and expansion effort throughout the Orion Arm of the galaxy. The blink network is grown through rapid construction of gates, and billions of colonists are sent out to tens of thousands of worlds over this time. This period represents the single largest movement of human life in recorded history.

- **4500U**: Cressidium is colonized

    Cressidium is colonized by refugees from the collapsing First Committee, leading to years of hardship and factional infighting.

- **4560U**: Union Civil War

    Mounting discontent with the great expansion, the growing need to address PISTON-1, and the acute criminality of the Hercynian Crisis boil over into widespread popular revolution across Cradle and some Galactic Core worlds. Union is gripped by civil war.

- **4591U**: Second Committee Surrenders

    The remaining Central Committee members of the Second Committee agree to terms of surrender in 4591U. Some portions of Second Committee flee to Diasporan planets or to places such at Harrison Armory.

- **4600U**: Founding of Third Committee

    New stable government in Union is formed, the Third Committee (ThirdComm). The Union Colonial Mission is immediately dissolved, and the Union Administrative Department is reconstituted. Expansion is halted.

- **5016U (Present Day)**: Operation Solstice Rain

    Ongoing diplomatic negotiations between Cressidium's major nations, the Leandric States Alliance and the Vestan Sovereignty, as they seek to join the Union once more. The UNS-CV Rio Grande, with recent academy graduates, is stationed for escort duties during the negotiations.

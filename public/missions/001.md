# Mission // #001
## Firewall
# Goals
- Facilitate attack on Eclipse Citadel by disabling artillery.
- Use distraction to infiltrate nearby Port Lilyhaven.
- Steal a vessel & launch under falsified Aun identification.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. Not acting quickly could mean a message is sent to Station Promise and operatives face extended resistance instead of infiltrating quietly.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
